## Variables

<br />

## What is a Variable?
Variables are the foundation of almost all programs. They allow you to store information. Think of variables as a box. You can put something in a box, you can take it out and change what is in it, you can access what is in a box. The same applies to variables.

## Data Types
There are a lot of different types of variables. Just like you have different types of boxes for different objects, you also have different types of storages for each variable. These storages are called data types.
int - the “int” data type can store integers
Eg: -1, 0, 4, 12 (no decimals)
double - the “double” data type stores floating point numbers (decimals)
Eg: -1.83, 3.42, 100.1
char - the “char” data type stores single characters
Eg: '' '' '' ''
Note: Characters always go in quotations to declare them or access them
boolean - a true or false value, 0 is denoted as false, 1 as true
Eg: True, False
A boolean can store no other information
Strings - a String is a collection of characters (char's)
Eg: “Hello”, “My name is Josh!”
Note: Strings also go in quotations; also note that it's capitalized which means when you declare a String, you also need to capitalize it

Declaring a Variable
Each variable has a data type, a name, and a value. Below you can see the format to declare a variable.

data_type variable_name = initial_value;

A variable's name can be used to access it and retrieve whatever value is stored in it. It is standard practice to initialize a variable with a value when you declare it, even if you don't know what is going to be stored in it yet. For example, an int would be set to 0, or a String to an empty string (“”)

Datatype Conversions

Other Notes
Naming Variables
A variables name cannot have any spaces
If the name has multiple words it is proper notation to make the first word lowercase the first word and capitalize the first letter of each subsequent word
Eg: String employeeName = “Jeff”
When naming a variable, it can technically be anything but the proper protocol is to name it a clear name so that anyone who is reading the code for the first time understand what the variable represents

## Examples

```java
int age = 25; double pi = 3.14159; String name = "Alice";
boolean isTrue = True;

int x = 5;
int y = 10;
int sum = x + y; // sum will be 15 
```

The C++
[standard library data structures](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/stl/) are
designed to store any type of data. We put the desired data type within the `<>`
brackets when declaring the data structure, as follows:

```cpp
vector<string> v;
```

This creates a `vector` structure that only stores objects of type `string`.

For our examples below, we will primarily use the `int` data type, but note that
you can use any data type including `string` and user-defined structures.

Nearly every standard library data structure supports the `size()` method, which
returns the number of elements in the data structure, and the `empty()` method,
which returns `true` if the data structure is empty, and `false` otherwise.
